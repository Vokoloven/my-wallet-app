# Hi there!

**_About_**: It's test application.

## Projects

For building project used **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + ReactJs**\
Some basic **Project** commands are:

| Command           | Description                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `npm install `    | Will installed dependencies      |
| `npm run dev`     | Start dev server                 |
| `npm run preview` | Locally preview production build |
| `npm run build`   | Build for production             |
| `npm run lint `   | Check errors by lint             |

**_Important_**\
Every project using **`WalletConnect SDKs`** needs to obtain projectId from **[WalletConnect](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)**, this is absolutely free and only takes a few minutes.\
Project include ignored **`.env`** file. You can check required variable in **`.env.example`**, and changed on yours.
